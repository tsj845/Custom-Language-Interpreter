mostly follows python syntax with a few differences

code blocks are brackets {}

strings can only be defined using double quotes ""

function definitions use the keyword "func"

currently not all features are available

NOTE: any features not in the feature list either won't work at all or will have unexpected behavior as they would be unimplemented

current feature list:
functions (with arguments),
strings,
booleans,
integers,
floats (in theory, but untested),
all assignments,
all equalities,
parentheses,
nested stuff,
variables,
local namespace (for functions)

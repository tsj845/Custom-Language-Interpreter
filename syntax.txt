mostly follows python syntax with a few differences

code blocks are brackets {}

function definitions use the keyword "func"

for loops follow the syntax "for [loopvar]([lower],[upper],[step])" note that any values in brackets are ones that must be provided by the programmer, brackets are not used in for loop parameters
